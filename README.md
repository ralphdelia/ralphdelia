## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ralph, a software engineer with a passion for how technology can help us understand the visual world. Recently, I have been particularly interested in image vector embeddings and their potential for organizing and exploring visual content.

Recently, I developed [Frame](https://www.frame-platform.com), an image search platform specifically designed for developers. It simplifies the entire embedding and image search process and deploys it directly to your AWS account. The platform provides image embedding and multimodal similarity search through a user-friendly API.

You can learn more about Frame [here](https://www.frame-platform.com/case-study/introduction/)!
