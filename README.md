## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ralph, a software engineer with a passion for how technology can help us understand the visual world. Recently, I have been particularly interested in image vector embeddings and their potential for organizing and exploring visual content.

### Frame 
Currently, I am working on [Frame](https://www.frame-platform.com), an image search platform designed for developers. It offers image embedding and multimodal similarity search through an easy-to-use API. This platform abstracts the entire embedding and image search pipeline and deploys it to your AWS account. You can learn more on the [website](https://www.frame-platform.com) or at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Frame-Platform/Frame).
