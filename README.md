## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ralph, a software engineer with a passion for how technology can help us understand the visual world. I bring a proactive mindset to teams and thrive in environments where I can tackle challenges that foster growth and continuous learning. Recently, I have been particularly interested in image vector embeddings and their potential for organizing and exploring visual content.

### Frame
I developed [Frame](https://www.frame-platform.com), an image search platform built for developers, offering image embedding and multimodal similarity search via an easy-to-use API. It abstracts the entire embedding and image search pipeline and deploys it to your AWS account.

You can learn more about Frame [here](https://www.frame-platform.com/case-study/introduction/)!
